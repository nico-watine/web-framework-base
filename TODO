Potential CSS utility classes:
	✔	heights (also min/max-heights) @done (19-08-06 04:51)
	✔	widths (and min/max-widths) @done (19-08-06 04:51)
	☐	Consider a global transition (transition:all 0.3s ease;)
	☐	tweak .border-radius-100 to represent via shape, bc -100 could be confused w 100px

Thoughts as they come:
	✔	Apache .htaccess snippets? @done (19-08-23 09:55)
	✔	<head> snippets @done (19-08-23 09:55)
	✔	favicon snippets @done (19-08-23 09:53)
	☐	SMM and sharing snippets for <head>
	☐	Some sort of gulp feature for CSSNano/UnCSS ?
	☐	Place each section's variables into a file within that given directory, rather than a top-level _var file?
	☐	border-radius (pill-shaped?)
	☐	border-radius (circle/fully round?)
	☐	CSS break-word

Typography Function Ideas:
	☐	Enable/disable responsive typography sizes via a setting?

Go back and look over:
	☐	heading tags within the beginning resets (only should be setting <h1> size and leave remaining <h> tags alone)

CSS Resets:
	☐	Potentially annotate which browser/version a certain reset is targeting?

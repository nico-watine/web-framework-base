Potential CSS utility classes:
	☐	heights (also min/max-heights)
	☐	widths (and min/max-widths)

Thoughts as they come:
	☐	Apache snippets?
	☐	<head> snippets
	☐	favicon snippets
	☐	SMM and sharing snippets for <head>

Typography Function Ideas:
	☐	Enable/disable responsive typography sizes via a setting?

Go back and look over:
	☐	heading tags within the beginning resets (only should be setting <h1> size and leave remaining <h> tags alone)

CSS Resets:
	☐	Potentially annotate which browser/version a certain reset is targeting?
